# PyBer_Analysis
Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of the analysis is to use Python skills and Pandas to create a summary of DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Once all the data is put together, Pandas and Matplotlib would be incorporated into creating a multiple line graph that will show the total weekly fares for each city type.

Results:

The image from the summary DataFrame shows that rural cities had the least number of drivers, rides and total fares followed by the suburban cities. The rural cities had the highest average fare per driver and ride, while the urban cities had the lowest. The urban cities had the greatest number of drivers which will in turn generate more rides leading to high levels of total fares compared to the other two cities (Rural and Suburban).

The image in the multiple-line chart shows that getting to the end of the month of February, total fares for each of the city types was high, thus telling that there was an increase in demand for rides at that time. It was also observed from the line chart that urban cities revenue increased within the first weeks of March. The start of April shows an increased in fares in the rural cities but towards the end of April, all three cities showed a decline in fares and hence revenue.

Summary:

The low number of available rides, drivers and total fares in the rural cities could be attributed to the low number of available rides and drivers in those cities. The drop in the number of ride usage could be resolved by allocating more rides and making it available for drivers in the rural cities. The suburban and urban areas can still benefit from this method to help meet demand
